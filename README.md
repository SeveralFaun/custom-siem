# üõ°Ô∏è Custom SIEM with Docker ELK

This repository contains a customized version of the [docker-elk](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk) stack, tailored for use in a local cybersecurity lab. It provides a lightweight SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) environment using:

- **Elasticsearch** for storing and indexing logs  
- **Logstash** for parsing and forwarding logs  
- **Kibana** for visualizing security events  

---

## üß∞ Environment Overview

- Host OS: Windows 11 with VMware Workstation
- Virtual Machines:
  - **SIEM VM** (Ubuntu) running ELK Stack
  - **Kali Linux** (attacker/log source)
  - **Metasploitable2** (vulnerable target)
- Network Mode: Host-only + NAT (dual adapter)

---

## üîß Setup Changes

- Added custom `filebeat.yml` to forward `/var/log/*.log`
- Enabled `logstash` to listen on custom ports
- Disabled xpack security for dev use

See [`docs/setup-notes.md`](docs/setup-notes.md) for configuration details and system changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Preconfigured for use with **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable2**
- Accepts and parses logs like `/var/log/auth.log`
- Visualizes login attempts, brute force attacks, and other system events
- Forward logs using `Filebeat`, `scp`, or other mechanisms
- Built for **learning**, **practicing detection engineering**, and **resume projects**
